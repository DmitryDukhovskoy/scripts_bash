Alan's utility

/scratch2/NCEPDEV/marine/Zulema.Garraffo/HYCOM-tools/bin/hycom_profile

To run it, in a directory that has regional.grid.a,b,
hycom_profile $i $j 
will give the profile.

/scratch2/NCEPDEV/marine/Zulema.Garraffo/wcoss2.paraD1/ush_plot/profile_example.sh does a profile starting from a long, lat.
An example of a profile is in the same directory,
prof_574_1379_120E_10S
or
profile_1324_1250_180_-20

I think Alan wants a profile with the format of his utility.
Alan's utility is

/scratch2/NCEPDEV/marine/Zulema.Garraffo/HYCOM-tools/bin/hycom_profile_list.F

If you give me what profile you want, I can get it as an example for you to check against
